# Indentation refers to spaces at the beginning of a line of code in python.

# it is not just a formatting technique but it is used to indicate a block of code and it is very important in python because wrong indentation can cause bugs in our codes and make it not to run


# here we can see how indentation is applied in python

akie = 5  # an int variable name akie with value 5

theresa = 8  # an int variable named theresa

# addition of two int variables called akie and theresa stored inside a variable called akpushu
akpushu = akie + theresa

if akpushu == 18:  # condition to check akpushu is equal to 18

    print("Hello")  # message to be displayed if true

# if the print statement is in the same line as the if statement our code is going to have an error


else:  # an esle block that will execute if akpushu is not equal to 18

    print("good bey")  # massage to be displayed if false

# if the print statement is in the same line as the else statement our code is going to have an error


# Program ends here
