# Computer programming is the procwss of performing 
# a particular computation, usually by designing and
# building an executable computer programme
# Below is a demostration of a programme to multiply two numbers
title = "A Program to multiply Two Numbers" # As string variable in which the program title is stored
print(title) #Display the program title using the print function to output on the terminal
num1= int(input("Enter First Number: ")) #Prompt User to Enter first Number using the input function and store the number(datatype INTEGER) in a variable
num2= int(input("Enter Second Number: ")) #Prompt User to Enter Second Number using the input function and store the number(datatype INTEGER) in a variable
total= num1 * num2 #add the first number and second number into a variable called total
print(f'Your answer is: {total}') #Prints the total from adding the two numbers in a formated way
